# US Campaign FEC Data Uploader

This project uploads CSV data files to a MySQL database. It reads configuration from a YAML file, processes multiple input files, and inserts data into MySQL tables.

## Setup

1. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure your MySQL connection and data file paths in `config/config.yaml`:**

    ```yaml
    mysql:
      host: your_mysql_host
      port: 3306
      username: your_username
      password: your_password
      database: your_database

    fec_data_files:
      - file: "data/ccl.txt"
        table_name: "candidate_committee_linkage"
        columns:
          - "CAND_ID"
          - "CAND_ELECTION_YR"
          - "FEC_ELECTION_YR"
          - "CMTE_ID"
          - "CMTE-TP"
          - "CMTE_DSGN"
          - "LINKAGE_ID"
      # Add other data files similarly
    ```

---

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:

Read the CSV/TXT files defined in the config.
Create corresponding tables (dropping existing ones if present).
Insert the data into your MySQL database.


## Notes

- Ensure the MySQL user has permissions to create/drop tables and insert data.
- The columns specified in the config must exactly match the columns in your data files.
- Data files are expected to be pipe (|) separated and do not include headers; columns are assigned from the config file.
- Column names with special characters (like hyphens -) are handled with backticks in SQL queries.

## ðŸ“‚ Official FEC Bulk Data Source

You can find the original Federal Election Commission bulk data files at:

ðŸ‘‰ [FEC-Data-Link](https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data)

This project uses files from that source for the 2019â€“2020 election cycle.


## Troubleshooting

- Column mismatch errors?
Verify the number of columns in your data files matches your config.
- MySQL syntax errors?
Confirm column names are properly quoted (backticks) and do not conflict with reserved keywords.
- Connection issues?
Ensure MySQL server is running, accessible, and credentials are correct.
